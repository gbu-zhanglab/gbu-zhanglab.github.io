# Research

We are interested in quantum phenomena in solid-state systems, especially in 2D materials. We will develop versatile  setups to probe and manipulate these phenomena.

**Nano optics**

We will develop optical setups equipped with a cryostat for studying quantum geometry in 2D materials.


**Quantum transport** 
We are interested in quantum transport behaviours in 2D materials, such as non-reciprocal charge transport, nonlinear Hall effect and quantum anomalous Hall effect. We will install a cryostat with superconducting magnets to perform electrical measurements at low temperature and high magnetic field.

### ... and more.
